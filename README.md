# gun-violence

This project aims to analyse gun violence trends in the United States from January 2014 to March 2018. The data used in this notebook has been obtained from the _Gun Violence Archive (GVA)_. The data is collected from over 6,500 law enforcement, media, government and commercial sources daily, and uploaded to [their website](https://gunviolencearchive.org) in real-time, as well as used for statistics on their social platforms. Following this analysis, the main findings are outlined below.

---
1. The number of incidents, casualties, and deaths, had been increasing every year from 2014 to 2018. There was approximately a 10,000 difference in number of incidents and casualties between 2014 and 2018, while the number of deaths had increased by 3,000.

2. On average, the number of incidents by month was declining between August and February, and then increased back between February and July. There were roughly 35 more incidents per day in July and August than February. The trends were however not similar every year, 2016 and 2017 suggesting more uniformity.

3. The date with the most recorded incidents of gun violence was the 1st of January 2017, with an overwhelming difference from the rest. On average, the 1st of January was the day of the year with the highest number of incidents, followed by the 4th of July (Independence Day) and the 5th of July.

4. Apart from New Year's Day and Independence Day, only two other federal holidays showed a significantly higher number of gun violence incidents than the average: Columbus Day and Memorial Day. Christmas was the holiday with the least number of gun violence incidents, roughly 30 below the average of 154. 

5. There was a small tendency for incidents to occur during the weekends.

6. The distribution by gender of both victims and suspects was highly skewed in favour of men, who made 93.4% of the suspects and 81.6% of the victims.

7. The majority of victims and suspects were between 18 and 25 years old. However, an alarming number of children were involved in incidents as well. 

8. The preferred weapon was the handgun, regardless of the nature of the incident.

9. The city with the highest gun crime was Chicago, about 2.5x more than the second city, Baltimore.

10. The state with the highest figures for gun crime per capita was DC, followed by Delaware and Alaska.
