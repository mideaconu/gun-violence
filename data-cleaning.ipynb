    "Gun ownership in the United States of America (USA) is legal and constitutionally protected by the United States Bill of Rights. The Second Amendment of the United States Constitution states that \"A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed.\" This amendment protects the right of law-abiding citizens to use firearms as a tool of self-defence. However, the circulation and possesion of firearms also poses an increased potential hazard to the life and wellbeing American citizens, as accidental or intentional discharges can imperil their lives. Consequently, a series of gun laws have been enacted throughout the years to decline the rate of occurance of gun violence incidents.\n",
    "\n",
    "The present notebook aims to analyse gun violence trends in the United States from January 2013 to March 2018, as well as the efficacy of gun laws throughout this period. The data used throughout this notebook has been obtained from the Gun Violence Archive (GVA), and made available by James Ko. GVA is a non-profit research group founded in 2013, whose goal is to provide accurate information about gun violence incidents to the public. The data is collected from over 6,500 law enforcement, media, government and commercial sources daily, and uploaded to their website (https://gunviolencearchive.org) in real-time, as well as used for statistics on their social platforms. GVA does not have an affiliation with any organisation or political party."
